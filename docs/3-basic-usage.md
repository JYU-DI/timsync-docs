# Basic usage

This chapter outlines the basic process of authoring
projects using TIMSync and describes the file structure of projects.

## Project structure

At the minimum, the TIMSync project structure is

```
.
|- .timsync
| |- config.toml
|
|- _config.yml
|- .gitignore
|- <any other project files>
```

The purpose of the files is as follows:

- **`.timsync` folder** contains syncing settings used by the TIMSync CLI.
  This folder is meant to only be locally available, so **do not upload the folder to any version control system** nor share the folder with other users.
- **`_config.yml`** is available for defining global settings for the project. Any variables that you define here will be available to use in templates under the `site` global variable. See [templating basics guide](./4-templating-basics.md) for more information.
- **`.gitignore`** is automatically generated by `timsync init` in case you are planning to use GIT for version control. The file defines `.timsync` folder as the only ignore to prevent it from being accidentally commited to version control.

## Creating documents

Folders and files that have no special meaning for TIMSync are processed
based on their file extension.

At the moment, TIMSync supports processing the following files:

- Markdown files (`.md` extension): Markdown files are converted to TIM documents and their contents are inserted into the final document as-is.
By default, the path of the final TIM document will be the same as the path
of the Markdown file -- in other words, any folder structure and file names
are preserved unless overwritten in [front matter](#front-matter).

- Style files (`.scss` or `.css` extensions): Style files are converted to TIM themes that can be used to change the look of the final TIM documents.
For more information about styles, refer to the [custom styles](./6-custom-styles.md) guide.

- Task plugin files (`.task.yaml` or `.task.yml` extensions): Task files are used to define tasks in TIM. The file defines various settings of the task along with task unique ID (UID). TIMSync uses task files to generate TIM tasks that it places in a global "task database document" in TIM. Once a task has been defined, it can be imported into Markdown documents using the `task` helper.
For more information about tasks, refer to the [plugin tasks](./5-plugin-tasks.md) guide.
